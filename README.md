Code here was used to make 3-band color-composite images of [GOODS](http://www.stsci.edu/science/goods/) 5-epoch data for the Galaxy Zoo projects. These images were classified on the site from March 27 - June 22, 2015. Classifications are released under [Willett et al. (in prep)](https://github.com/willettk/gzhubble).
