Notes from discussion between Brooke and Kyle on Fri 27 Jun 2014
===

* repixelate images to 424x424
* examine the stretch and appropriate values for each band
* Steven's noise decoloring with a raised floor; either import to IDL or add as Python
** Nonlinearity level of 3.0 +- 0.5 seems appropriate to bring out detail and raise noise floor a bit.
